# Luca's website
This is a repository to document the growth of my hobby. Feel free to take code and use it as you will. 

## Usage
* Clone it in your Server root ```git clone https://github.com/AnInternetTroll/Website.git```
  * You can also download the zip if you don't have git
* Give it some permissions ```sudo chmod -R 0777 Website```
  * Sidenote, I'm not sure what permission it wants, but comments will not work without this.
* Done, feel free to use and change it as you like.
