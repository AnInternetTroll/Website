This is a repository to document the growth of my hobby. Feel free to take code and use it as you will.

## Usage

1. Install a webserver service which supports PHP. Apache is a great one and you can read more about it on [this article Ubuntu wrote](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-and-configure-apache#2-installing-apache, "How to install Apache").
2. Clone it in the server root with `git clone https://github.com/AnInternetTroll/Website.git .`
3. Install dependencies using `composer install` and `npm install`
4. You might have to mod the files as sometimes they don't have permissions to write comments, so do that with `sudo chmod -R 0777 .`
5. Done, feel free to use it, change it and do whatever you want with it
