# Luca's website

This is a repository to document the growth of my hobby. Feel free to take code and use it as you will.

## Usage

- Clone it in your Server root `git clone https://github.com/AnInternetTroll/Website.git`
  - You can also download the zip if you don't have git
- Give it some permissions `sudo chmod -R 0777 Website`
  - Sidenote, I'm not sure what permission it wants, but comments will not work without this.
- For developers `npm install` and `composer install` should help with packages, as not all of them are packaged on github to save storage.
- Done, feel free to use and change it as you like.
