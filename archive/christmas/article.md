# Everything about Christmas in America.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Have you ever wondered how people in America celebrate Christmas? Do they have a Santa that eats porridge? Do they eat marzipan? What is up with the christmas movies?

### How it all started:

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the New Testament says that Jesus was born in Bethlehem, by some propnhecy. When Joseph and Mary arrived in the city, the inn had no room and so they were offered a stable where the Christ (Jesus) child was soon born. Angels gave this news to shepherds who then spred the information further.

### Gifts

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But why do we give gifts to each other? Tip: It's not because you were good year-round.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It is said that three Wise men, Melchior, Gaspar and Balthazar gave gifts to little baby Jesus, since we can't give gifts to Jesus, because he is dead, we give gifts to each other.

### Santa Claus is coming to town

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I'm really sorry to inform you but Santa doesn't exist. If you don't know who he is, he is a fat old man in red that breaks into your house through the chimney to leave presents under your Christmas tree or in you Christmas stocking. He only gives presents to kids who have been good the whole year, those who weren't get coal. But that was in the old days, now everyone gets presents it doesn't matter if they were good or bad. Oh, and you have to leave him milk and cookies, so he doesn't get hungry.

##### But who is he really?

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He is Saint Nickolas. He was a monk in the 3rd century, much admired for his piety and kindness. Over time Nicholasâ€™s popularity spread and he became known as the protector of children and sailors.

### Celebration

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Christmas is a public holiday which means no school, but you still have to help your mom cook food that will last you the rest of the year, at least you don't have to decorate because you did it in November.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After watching romantic Christmas movies for a month and decorating way too early, on the 24th and 25th of December, you and the rest of your family sit down and eat everything: from a whole pig to mashed potatoes, salad, fish and of course cranberry sauce. And then when you can't eat anymore there is dessert.
