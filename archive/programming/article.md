# Turtle
This is a collection of animations made by me, Luca-Matei Pintilie. 

## Usage
Just go ahead and click on a button, this will take you to a white canvans where a magically invisable craion will draw and change colors according to a pre-made algorithm. To stop an animation from playing you just need to hold down spacebar.

## Cut content
There are a couple of cut animations from the final release. These will be called `cut[x]`. 
There's also a 3rd page cut, but it's fully empty.

## Backwards compatibility
This project is 100% compatible with scratch 2.0 and 3.0, but it's lacking compatibility with scratch 1.4, mainly the "when backdrop changes" event blocks are not supported, but the project has been avoiding to use functions for backwards compatibility purposes.

## Suggestions/improvements
Feel free to post your ideas in the comments bellow as detailed as possible and, if possible, with forks of your own :)
